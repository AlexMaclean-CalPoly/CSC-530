# Program Verification as Constraint Solving
**805 Kitchen:** Alex MacLean, Bailey Wickham

## Progress
For this project we built a partial implementation of the pipeline described in Section 2 for program verification. Given a program in an s-expression syntax (similar to the paper, but with more parentheses) we generate the second-order contrains from the control flow graph, then generate the first order constraints based on command line specifications.
